Description:
 Full implementation of two way RSA encrypted communcation between two arduinos over Serial protocol

Included files:
 - encrypted_communication_part2.cpp
 - Makefile

Wiring instructions:
 -> Note pins on arduino X are denoted as such: PIN (X)
 -> Two Arduinos are used (denoted A, B)
 GND (A) -> GND (B)
 TX3 (A) -> RX3 (B)
 RX3 (A) -> TX3 (B)
 PIN 13 (A) -> 560 Ohm Resistor -> 5V (A)
 PIN 13 (B) -> GND (B)

Notes:
 - uint32_to_serial, uint32_from_serial, wait_on_serial3, and powmod functions used are
   slight modifications of the provided functions in assignments and lectures
